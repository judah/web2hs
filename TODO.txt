Maybe rename module Hierarchy to make "Web" explicit?
Conflicts (anything more than operator precedence and if/then/else?)

Missing features from parser:
 - records
 - "case" expressions
 - "while" loops
 - negative numbers
 - Anything else?

Finish pretty-printer for the whole AST, and fix semicolons/begin..end blocks.

Hard things to implement:

Built-in functions:
 - chr: convert integer to character
 - write, writeln
 - reset
 - eof
 - read
 - eoln
 - readln
gotos (esp. at end?)
