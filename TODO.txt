Maybe rename module Hierarchy to make "Web" explicit?
Conflicts (anything more than operator precedence and if/then/else?)

Missing features from parser:
 - "case" statements:
    - cases can be arbitrary constants.  Unclear if TeX ever actually does
      that.
 - Possibly keywords from ISO: in, nil, set
 - Anything else?

Lexer errors aren't reported well.  (E.g., when I didn't lex periods.)

Finish pretty-printer for the whole AST, and fix semicolons/begin..end blocks.

In this: http://www.moorecad.com/standardpascal/iso7185rules.html#Program structure
under "program structure"
they make the case that function blocks are the same as program blocks.

Hard things to implement:

Built-in functions:
 - chr: convert integer to character
 - write, writeln
 - reset
 - eof
 - read
 - eoln
 - readln
gotos (esp. at end?)
